    "data": "The Polytechnic, Ibadan is a public tertiary institution located in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. It was established on August 7, 1970 as a successor to the Technical College, Ibadan under the Polytechnic Ibadan Edict 1970, with the mandate to provide technical and vocational education and training in applied science, engineering, environmental studies, commerce and agriculture. The institution operates a multi-campus structure and is known for its motto ‘Ise Loogun Ise’, a Yoruba phrase meaning ‘Work is the medicine for poverty’, symbolising the value of hard work. Over the years, the polytechnic has produced middle‑ and high‑level manpower for various industries and has evolved to include full‑time National Diploma (ND) and Higher National Diploma (HND) programmes, Daily Part‑Time Programme (DPP) and Continuing Education Centre (CEC) part‑time programmes. It houses several faculties – Engineering, Environmental Studies, Science, Business and Communication Studies, Financial Management Studies and Vocational & Technical Education – each offering a variety of ND and HND programmes. Admission into ND programmes requires at least five credit passes at O’level (including English and Mathematics) and a minimum UTME score prescribed by JAMB (typically 150)【495664491148919†L108-L115】. HND admission demands a relevant ND certificate with a minimum of lower credit, completion of at least one‑year industrial training, and five credit passes at O’level【495664491148919†L159-L245】. Daily Part‑Time and CEC part‑time programmes admit candidates who purchase part‑time admission forms through the JAMB platform and meet the same O’level credit requirements; DPP applicants must obtain a JAMB registration number and have a minimum UTME score of 150【703792631874867†L32-L126】【902312501591338†L25-L115】.
